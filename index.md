### R Projects

- [Electricity Project](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmzesdg00nfjdw8/electricity_project.pdf?dl=0)
+  Performed a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis project** provides insight into the **distribution of electricity** generated by different sources across the world and how such distribution has changed over time at both country and region levels. 

- [Spatial Distribution of Air Pollutants](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YLQTpE3e5_7Z70Jxq0sKhtwX7LUfV-86bd_GhQERCDY/edit)

+  Conducted a **spatial analysis** of air pollutants impacting asthma applying **GIS, Principal Component Analysis**,and **hierarchical clustering**. Three clusters were identified and utilized to explain the asthma pattern. The project won an **abstract award** and the author was recognized as a **student scholar** at the American Thoracic Society 2018 meeting.
